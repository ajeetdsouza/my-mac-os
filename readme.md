> List of applications and tools that make my macOS experience even more amazing

## Applications

I use a [lot of apps](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz/config#macos-apps-i-have-installed) on my mac. Below is a list of my favorite tools with descriptions of how I use them.

I also share [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) together with my [iOS setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios). And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

I have [extensive wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) where I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/everything-I-know). Apps that I described in the wiki are linked to from here.

### Changing themes

I made [KM macro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) with [this AppleScript](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/change-light-dark-mode-applescript-app/) to switch [between light/dark macOS appearances](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1311336647338983432). As appearances are switched, the themes get updated accordingly on most apps.
